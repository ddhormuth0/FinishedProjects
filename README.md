# FinishedProjects
A portfolio of games and applications I created or collaborated on.

Description Of Each Application Below Along With The Class It Was Created For And The Language Used


AVLTree (Java)(Developed By Myself)(COSC 310 Data Sturctures and Algorithm Analysis)

Using a csv file that contains a list of names and data attached to them, a AVL tree is created from them. It automatically balances itself and stores the values of each persons' interest on each node. The program allows insertion of a name, searching, and printing of the tree in inorder preorder and postorder.


InstantMeesegerUsingUDP (Java)(Developed By Myself)(COSC 331 Fundamentals of Computer Networks)

This file contain two programs, one client and one server. It uses UDP to send messages from client to server and it can be done in real time. Both the server and the client can send and recieve messages at the same time because of the use of threads. The server establishes the port for communication and prints both the port and the IP so that the client can connect to it.


InstantVoiceMessengerClient (Java)(Developed By Myself)(COSC 331 Fundamentals of Computer Networks)

Using UDP, instead of sending messages, this allows voice to be transmitted between a client and a server. The users of the client and server devices can speak to each other like VOIP. 


InstantVoiceMessengerServer (Java)(Developed By Myself)(COSC 331 Fundamentals of Computer Networks)

This is the server program of the InstantVoiceMessenger. It establishes the port for communication and prints both the port and the IP so that the client can connect to it.


MapNavigation (Java)(Developed By Myself)(COSC 310 Data Sturctures and Algorithm Analysis)

This program reads a map from a given document and turns it into a graph. Using the input map it creates the graph by assiging nodes and appropriate edges. The map is a dungeon where "Zelda" must find her way through to get a health potion. The graph uses depth first search to find the correct path and the amount of steps it will take her to find the x.


PokedexHashMap (Java)(Developed By Myself)(COSC 310 Data Sturctures and Algorithm Analysis)

This program reads a file with the information of almost every Pokemon. Using this file it stores each Pokemon in a hashmap. Collsions are handled via linear probing. In the program you can search the hash table for pokemon, add pokemon, delete pokemon, check the current load factor, and check the amount of pokemon in the hash table.


Valiant Brawl (Unity/C#)(Developed in a Team of 4)(COSC 325 Software Engineering)

This is a game developed in unity that I collaborated on with other members in my class. It is a 2D fighting game that is based on games like Brawlhalla. I worked on implementing the game functions like the combat, player movement, implementing animations, user interface (health bar, timer, mana bar), and the game win system. Assets that we used from other developers include:

Hero Knight (2D Knight Art and Animation) - By Sven Thole

Evil Wizard (2D Mage Art and Animation) - By Luiz Melo

2D Forest Beauty Pack (Background Art) - By ROMPAS Studios

2D Jungle Side-Scrolling Platformer Pack (Platform Art) - By Super Brutal Assets
